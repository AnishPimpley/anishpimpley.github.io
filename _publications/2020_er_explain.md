excerpt: 'We investigate the performance of two methods for explaining tree-based models: ‘Tree Interpreter (TI)’ and 'SHAP TreeExplainer (SHAP-TE)'. Using a case study on detecting anomalies in job runtimes of applications that utilize cloud-computing platforms, we compare these approaches using metrics such as computation time, significance of attribution value, and explanation accuracy.'
