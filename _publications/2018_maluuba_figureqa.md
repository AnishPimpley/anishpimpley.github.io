excerpt: 'We try to explore the task of relational reasoning (compositionality, physical interractions) via the specific problem of question answering in the space of plots and figures using the FigureQA dataset. We build on the ideas of task specific architectures such as Relation Networks and task generic architectures like FiLM to improve the state of the art performance on the FigureQA dataset'
