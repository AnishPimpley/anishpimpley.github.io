### 1. Stagewise non-uniform regularization for Cascade classifiers
[link](https://github.com/AnishPimpley/anishpimpley.github.io/blob/master/media/Stage-wise%20Non-uniform%20Regularization%20for%20Cascade.pdf)                 
*keywords : ML for Healthcare, ML on edge/IOT devices*   

We propose a new approach to building cascaded classifiers in computation sensitive, low power environments. We extend the firm cascade architecture by introducing non-uniform stage-wise regression terms into the loss function. We introduce a modification over the L1 regularizer, tuned to encourage sparse connections. We evaluate the effects of such a regularizer on use cases with imbalanced classes such as human activity recognition and smoking detection.

### 2. Hand-drawn images to Simulink programs
*keywords : Computer Vision, Deep Learning*   

We convert rough hand drawn images of full simulink diagrams and convert them to full working Simulink models in machine. I worked on the exraction, detection and classification part of the pipeline.      
We made a custom dataset, finetuned an imagenet pretrained GoogLeNet based model and used classical vision, topological, density and connectivity properties to extract the graphical structure and flow from the image.

### 3. Convert Audio files to Video of person speaking
*keywords : Deeplearning, Vision, Multi-modal ML*   

We use an LSTM to take an audio file as input and generate a video of a person speaking in sync with the audio file.
The goal is to preserve facial landmarks. 
The base face model is input as the initial state of the LSTM and the audio signal for a particular time interval is fed at each timestep.

### 4. Exploring Sophisticated Loss Functions for Early Prediction in CNNS: 
[link](https://github.com/AnishPimpley/anishpimpley.github.io/blob/master/media/Exploring%20Sophisticated%20Loss%20Functions%20for%20Early.pdf)        
*keywords : Deeplearning, Vision, Compute-aware ML*   

We investigate the effects of using sophisticated cascade loss functions on early predictions in image classification tasks. We apply methods native to cascade classifiers, to guide the learning of Convolutional Neural Networks. We approach the problem by trying to identify the depth and if to place an intermediate classifier in a CNN pipeline, so as to achieve a better accuracy-cost trade-off. We use a modified AlexNet as the base model. We also extend the soft cascade and firm cascade loss functions to the multi-label case using each for training the model.

### 5. Predicting Neighborhoods most affected by Crime using Infrastructure and Economic Indicators: 
[link](https://github.com/AnishPimpley/anishpimpley.github.io/blob/master/media/Minority%20Report.pdf)        
*keywords : Computational Social Science, Dataset creation*   

We propose a novel approach to predict crime for neighborhoods in a city from
multiple sources, in particular nearby landmarks, census and demographic data. Many prior studies
have tried to predict crime based on demographic and socio-economic data, but there has been no
prior work on prediction of crime based on landmarks data. We were able to successfully show that
local infrastructure data plays a more important role in predicting crime incidents. We also showed
the importance of different features on crime rate. We were able to confirm the results of prior
studies related to correlation between crime, and schools and banks.
