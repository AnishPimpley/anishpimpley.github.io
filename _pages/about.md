I’m an Applied Scientist II with Microsoft AI platform. I work on rapid prototyping and envisioning future ML products for AI platform & Cognitive services. Previously at Microsoft’s AI Development Acceleration Program (MAIDAP) at the Office of Applied Research.     

My current work focuses on large language models like GPT-3 and solving open real-world problems in the abstractive-NLP domain.               

Over the years, my work has spanned the breadth of problems in the areas of Deep Learning and ML. In additition to NLP, I have previously worked on substaintial projects in the domains of Vision, Interpretability and ML for Systems.

Misc:
=====
I spend most of my leisure time cooking, learning musical instruments and climbing (with varying degree of success).                
I love ranting about terrible urban design and discussing geo-politics.                   
I am fascinated by all sorts of meta information, which doesn’t help my case of going down random internet rabbit holes.
