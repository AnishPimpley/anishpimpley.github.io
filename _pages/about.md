Misc:
=====
I spend most of my leisure time cooking, learning musical instruments and climbing (with varying degree of success).                
I love ranting about terrible urban design and discussing geo-politics.                   
I am fascinated by all sorts of meta information, which doesn’t help my case of going down random internet rabbit holes.
