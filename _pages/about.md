About Me:
======
I’m an Applied Scientist II working on rapid prototyping and envisioning future ML products for Microsoft’s AI platform & Cognitive services. Previously at Microsoft’s AI Development Acceleration Program (MAIDAP) at the Office of Applied Research.                  
My current work focuses on massive language models, dataset creation and solving open real-world problems in the abstractive-NLP domain.               
Over the years, my has work spanned the breadth of problems in the areas of Deep Learning and ML. In additition to NLP, I have previously worked on substaintial projects in the domains of Vision, Interpretability and ML for Systems.

Past-year's Highlights:
=====

**Satya Nadella's GPT-3 Ignite Keynote** - Our work on using GPT-3 for summarization and content generation for WNBA was featured as one of 2 demos in Satya's 2021 Ignite keynote.

Misc:
=====
I spend most of my leisure time cooking, learning musical instruments and climbing (with varying degree of success).                
I love ranting about terrible urban design and discussing geo-politics.                   
I am fascinated by all sorts of meta information, which doesn’t help my case of going down random internet rabbit holes.
