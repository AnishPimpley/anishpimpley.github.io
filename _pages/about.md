_Trying something new as Founding Applied Scientist at a small shop with big dreams. Stay tuned for updates._

Previously worked as Applied Scientist II working with Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services &  Microsoft’s AI Development Acceleration Program ([MAIDAP](https://www.microsoftnewengland.com/maidap/)) at the Office of Applied Research.     

My current work focuses on building products with massively-pretrained models like GPT & SD.                           
Over the years, my work has spanned the breadth of problems in the areas of Deep Learning and ML. In additition to NLP, I have previously worked on major projects in the domains of Vision, Interpretability and ML for Systems.

***Keywords***:                
GPT-3, Large Language Models, Chatbots, Transformers, Stable Diffusion                      
GNNs, Interpretability, Deep Learning, VQA

Past-year's Highlights:
=====

Misc:
=====
I spend most of my leisure time cooking, learning musical instruments and climbing (with varying degree of success).                
I love ranting about terrible urban design and discussing geo-politics.                   
I am fascinated by all sorts of meta information, which doesn’t help my case of going down random internet rabbit holes.
