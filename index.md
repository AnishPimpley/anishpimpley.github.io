# About me

> I am a 2nd year masters student in Computer Science at UMass Amherst with ~2 years of prior industry experience. 
>
> I work on problems in the broad area of Machine Learning and related fields. I am however, keenly interested in the Deep Learning and Computer Vision sub-domains.

## Other

#### Hand-drawn images to Simulink programs
We convert rough hand drawn images of full simulink diagrams and convert them to full working Simulink models in machine. I worked on the exraction, detection and classification part of the pipeline.      
We made a custom dataset, finetuned an imagenet pretrained GoogLeNet based model and used classical vision, topological, density and connectivity properties to extract the graphical structure and flow from the image.
