# About me

> I am a Data Scientist at Microsoft's AI Development Acceleration Program ([MAIDAP](http://www.microsoftnewengland.com/nerd-ai/)). 
>
> I work on problems in the broad area of Machine Learning and Data Science. I am however, keenly interested in deep learning and multi-modal data source problems scenarios.

## Other

#### Hand-drawn images to Simulink programs
We convert rough hand drawn images of full simulink diagrams and convert them to full working Simulink models in machine. I worked on the exraction, detection and classification part of the pipeline.      
We made a custom dataset, finetuned an imagenet pretrained GoogLeNet based model and used classical vision, topological, density and connectivity properties to extract the graphical structure and flow from the image.

###### Video Demonstration of the extraction & classification process :

#### Convert Audio files to Video of person speaking
We use an LSTM to take an audio file as input and generate a video of a person speaking in sync with the audio file.
The goal is to preserve facial landmarks 
The base face model is input as the initial state of the LSTM and the audio signal for a particular time interval is fed at each timestep.

## Skill Map 

A genereric map of areas in Computer Science that I have worked with. For detailed information see resume.       
The purpose of this graph is to provide quick visual intuition for what my profile looks like.
Also visualizations are nice to look at.

## Misc

I spend most of my leisure time cooking, trying new cuisines or watching cooking videos. On other occasions, I am not-so-successfully trying to improve my guitar skills and looking for excuses to go kayaking.    
I am fascinated by all sorts of meta information, which doesn't help my case of going down random internet rabbit holes.
